# Marine Ecology & Geospatial Data


My work lies at the interface between optical remote sensing and applied marine ecology, focusing on methods to map coastal and underwater ecosystems, with emphasis on macroalgal forests and seagrass meadows.

I adopt a multiscale perspective, integrating 3D underwater models, UAS imagery, and satellite data. From these sources, habitats map are generated using a range of approaches, from manual digitisation and classical machine-learning methods to more recent deep-learning techniques. A central component of my work is the collection of high-quality field data, in both intertidal and subtidal environments, to assess and interpret model outputs and map quality.
