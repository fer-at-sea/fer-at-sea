# Marine Ecology & Geospatial Data Analysis


My work lies at the interface between optical remote sensing and applied marine ecology, focusing on methods to map coastal and underwater ecosystems, with emphasis on macroalgal forests and seagrass meadows. Building on a multiscale perspective, 3D underwater models, UAS/AUV imagery, and satellite data are integrated to generate habitats maps using a range of approaches including manual digitisation, empirical machine-learning methods and physics-based models. A central component of this research is the collection of high-quality field data, in both intertidal and subtidal environments, to assess and interpret model outputs and map quality.
